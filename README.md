Title: COVID19 Visualizer
Files: Country.java, Main.java
Author: Maxwell Mougette, mougette@wisc.edu

Used JavaFX to create visual representations of current COVID 19 data for 270 countries using data from John Hopkins University. Supports visualizations for number of cases, number of deaths, cases to population, deaths to cases, and a least squared regression model.

Notes:
-Population size data is not complete for all 270 countries. Countries without population data have a temp value of size 1.
-Least Squared Regression model still in development.
